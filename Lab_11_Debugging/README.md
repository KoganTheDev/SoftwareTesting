## 🛠️ Debugging in Visual Studio

### 🔧 Setting Up Debugging

1. **Start Debugging**:  
   Press **F5** or go to **Debug > Start Debugging** to run your program in debug mode.
   - This compiles and launches your program with the debugger enabled.

2. **Configure Debug Settings**:  
   Go to **Debug > Options** to tweak debugging preferences, including enabling step-through debugging and more.

### 💡 Common Debugging Techniques

- **Step Over** (F10):  
   Execute the current line and move to the next one.

- **Step Into** (F11):  
   Dive deeper into a function or method call.

- **Step Out** (Shift + F11):  
   Return from the current method to the caller.

### 🚨 Using Breakpoints

Breakpoints are crucial for pausing execution at critical points in your code.  
- **Set a Breakpoint**:  
   Click in the gutter next to the line number or press **F9**.
  
- **Conditional Breakpoints**:  
   Right-click the breakpoint and select "Conditions" to set conditions for triggering the breakpoint.

#### 🌟 Tip:  
Use **Watch Windows** to track the values of specific variables during debugging.

## 🔄 Hungarian Algorithm for Assignment Problems

### 💡 What is the Hungarian Algorithm?

The **Hungarian algorithm** is a combinatorial optimization algorithm that solves assignment problems with minimal cost. It works on a matrix of costs, such as assigning workers to tasks, to find the optimal matching with minimal expense or maximum profit.

### 📈 Steps for the Hungarian Algorithm

1. **Subtract Row Minimum**:  
   For each row, subtract the smallest element of that row from all elements in the row.

2. **Subtract Column Minimum**:  
   For each column, subtract the smallest element in that column from all elements in the column.

3. **Cover Zeros with Minimum Lines**:  
   Cover all zeros in the matrix using the fewest number of horizontal and vertical lines.

4. **Create Additional Zeros**:  
   If fewer lines are used than needed, adjust the matrix by adding and subtracting values to generate more zeros.

5. **Repeat** until the optimal assignment is found.

### 📝 Example

Here’s a simple cost matrix for assigning workers to tasks:

|       | T1 | T2 | T3 |
|-------|----|----|----|
| **W1** | 4  | 6  | 8  |
| **W2** | 2  | 4  | 7  |
| **W3** | 3  | 5  | 9  |

#### Step 1: Subtract Row Minimum
- Row 1: Subtract 4 → `[0, 2, 4]`
- Row 2: Subtract 2 → `[0, 2, 5]`
- Row 3: Subtract 3 → `[0, 2, 6]`

Matrix after row subtraction:
|       | T1 | T2 | T3 |
|-------|----|----|----|
| **W1** | 0  | 2  | 4  |
| **W2** | 0  | 2  | 5  |
| **W3** | 0  | 2  | 6  |

#### Step 2: Subtract Column Minimum
- Column 1: Subtract 0 → No change.
- Column 2: Subtract 2 → `[0, 0, 0]`.
- Column 3: Subtract 4 → `[0, 1, 2]`.

Matrix after column subtraction:
|       | T1 | T2 | T3 |
|-------|----|----|----|
| **W1** | 0  | 0  | 0  |
| **W2** | 0  | 0  | 1  |
| **W3** | 0  | 0  | 2  |

#### Step 3: Cover Zeros with Minimum Lines  
This step is where the optimal assignment is found.
