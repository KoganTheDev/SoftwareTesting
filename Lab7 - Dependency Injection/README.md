## 🌟 Overview
This document explains the concepts of **Seams**, **Stubs**, and **Dependency Injection** in software testing, which are vital for creating testable, maintainable, and reliable software systems. 

These techniques allow developers to isolate and test components effectively, ensuring that the software behaves as expected under various conditions.

## 🔍 What Are Seams?
A **Seam** is a location in the code where behavior can be altered without modifying the code itself. Seams allow you to inject different behaviors during testing, making it easier to isolate and test components.

### 💡 Example
In object-oriented programming, a seam might be a method that can be overridden in a subclass.

---

## 🛠️ What Are Stubs?
A **Stub** is a minimal implementation of a method or an object that mimics the behavior of a real dependency. Stubs are used to simulate specific conditions or outputs in tests without relying on the actual implementation.

### 📌 Key Points
- **Purpose:** Simplifies testing by replacing real dependencies.
- **Usage:** Simulates responses like exceptions or fixed values.

---

## 🔄 What Is Dependency Injection?
**Dependency Injection (DI)** is a design pattern used to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies. Instead of creating dependencies internally, they are passed to the class externally, improving testability and flexibility.

### 📂 Types of Dependency Injection
1. **Constructor Injection**
2. **Setter Injection**
3. **Interface Injection**

## 💻 Examples

### ✨ Seams in Action
```java
public class Calculator {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b; // Standard addition method.
    }
}

// Seam: Subclass overriding the add method for testing.
class MockCalculator extends Calculator {
    @Override
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return 42; // Fixed response for testing.
    }
}
```

### 🧩 Using Stubs
```python
class PaymentGateway:
    def process_payment(self, amount):
        # Actual implementation, which could involve network calls.
        pass

class PaymentGatewayStub(PaymentGateway):
    def process_payment(self, amount):
        # Stubbed method returning a controlled response.
        return "Payment processed: $" + str(amount)

# Test using the stub
stub = PaymentGatewayStub()
print(stub.process_payment(100))  # Output: Payment processed: $100
```

### 🛠️ Dependency Injection
```cpp
#include <iostream>
class Logger {
public:
    virtual void log(const std::string& message) = 0; // Abstract method to log messages.
};

class ConsoleLogger : public Logger {
public:
    void log(const std::string& message) override {
        std::cout << message << std::endl; // Logs messages to the console.
    }
};

class App {
    Logger* logger; // Dependency passed externally.
public:
    App(Logger* logger) : logger(logger) {}
    void run() {
        logger->log("Application started"); // Uses the injected logger.
    }
};

int main() {
    ConsoleLogger consoleLogger; // Create a specific logger instance.
    App app(&consoleLogger); // Inject the logger into the application.
    app.run(); // Start the application, logging to the console.
}
```

## 🌟 Advantages of These Techniques
- **Seams:** Simplify testing by allowing modifications at specific points.
- **Stubs:** Enable controlled testing environments and predictable outcomes.
- **Dependency Injection:** Improves flexibility and testability by decoupling dependencies.

---

## 🏁 Conclusion
Seams, Stubs, and Dependency Injection are foundational concepts in software testing that help create modular, testable, and maintainable code. By leveraging these techniques, developers can improve the quality and reliability of their software systems.
