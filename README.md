## 📝 Topics Covered

### 1. Project Management and Development Processes 🚀
   - **Agile and V-Model** methodologies for managing development cycles.
   - **Scrum**: Iterative approach for project progress.
   - **TDD (Test-Driven Development)**: Writing tests before code to drive design.

### 2. Refactoring Techniques 🛠️
   - Refactoring to improve code readability and performance.
   - Techniques to simplify complex code while maintaining functionality.

### 3. Static Code Analysis 🧐
   - **Static Analysis**: Identifying potential issues without running code.
   - Using tools to enhance code quality and reduce bugs early on.

### 4. Code Quality and Inspection 🔍
   - Ensuring code quality through:
     - **Code Inspection**: Manual and automated review processes.
     - **Code Smells Detection**: Identifying areas needing improvement.

### 5. Advanced Testing Techniques 🧩
   - **Stubs and Shims**: Simplifying tests by replacing components.
   - **Inversion of Control** and **Dependency Injection** for easier testing.
   - **Mocks and Test Doubles**: Simulating parts of the codebase.
   - **Unit Testing** and **Integration Testing**: Verifying component reliability.

### 6. Testing Tools and Environment Setup 🛠️
   - Configuring **Eclipse** and **Visual Studio** for testing.
   - Implementing **Mockito** for creating test doubles.
   - **TDD Practices** in both **C#** and **Java** environments.

### 7. Code Coverage and Performance Testing 📈
   - Measuring **Code Coverage** to ensure test effectiveness.
   - **Debugging** best practices to fix and enhance code.
   - Conducting **Performance Testing** to validate application efficiency.
